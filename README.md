# Meal-App


### Project Description
```
A Meal Application that shows random meal and user can search and view the details of selected meals. This project is developed in Vue js .
```

### Application is developed using VueJS framework
> I have chosen VueJS (a progressive JavaScript framework) because this leads to improve the structure of the code and building user interfaces, it provides the benefits of reactive data binding and composable view components with an API that is as simple as possible and can be used for simple and complex applications as the state management is easy and intuitive. <br>
> Vue has a community that makes it better every day and because of the flexibility it has when changing the theme of the project and this framework can be easy to understand and implement as compared to ReactJs and AngularJs. <br>
> Vue.Js has an efficient state management system in the form of Vuex and Vue Router. It has a wide range of ready-to-use plugins and the product development is cost-effective.

- Vue cli (v4.5.8)
